	<h3> What is IT Consulting? </h3> 
		<p> Information technology is the use of systems in order to store, retrieve or send information. An IT consultant is someone that advises their clients on how to use IT to meet their and objectives and solve their problems. IT consultancy is such a broad field of work that involves a wide array of different skills and tasks that trying to generalize it does not do it justice. I will instead talk about what I specifically have an interest in when it comes to IT, and that is analytics and information management. I will then talk about why I want to get involved in analytics and information management and what specific roles I want to play within that. </p>
	<h3> Why Analytics and Information Management? </h3> 
		<p> We live in a world in which we have more data than we know what to do with it; hence, why the big data phenomenon is so prevalent in our society. The systems we built to manage operations for our companies have been accumulating massive amounts of data for decades, and many companies are asking themselves the same questions: what does this data mean and how can I leverage it to further expand my business? These are the types of questions I want to solve. In order to answer the questions at hand, companies need people that can look at a massive set of data with the goal of managing and analyzing it in such a way that can help them achieve various business oriented goals. Business oriented goals often include, but are not limited to, maximizing potential, developing new products and services, increasing efficiency and increasing sales. That is where I come in as an analytics and information management consultant. </p>
		<P> As an analytics and information management consultant I can assist businesses in many ways, from shaping strategy to managing data. However, I am most interested in using data analytics to shape strategy. Shaping strategy consists of many things, but I am most interested in analyzing data that aids a company in their strategies towards innovation and risk/reward ventures. As a data analyst I will have the capability of shaping a company’s strategy that will help them with some of the business goals mentioned above: developing new products and services and increasing efficiency and sales. </p>
	<h3> Why Consulting is Right for Me </h3>
		<p> Consulting is an extremely mentally challenging, physically and emotionally taxing job no matter the area of expertise. That is what makes it so intriguing. As a young man with an abundance of energy and a thirst for learning, any type of consulting would be an excellent starting point for a career. It just so happens that my interest in technology and data has been prevalent for many years now. I love data because it provides us with something we can concretely base our thinking off of, because it is not ambiguous. I also think having the ability to present a large amount of data in a way that people can understand is incredibly satisfying. Also, we are at a point where businesses have problems that can only be solved by the data that they possess. I want to be a part of a team of people that work to solve those problems every day, and in the next section I will talk about some of those problems in which the solutions require data and technology. </p>
	<h3> What is the Life of a Consultant Like? </h3>
		<p> Long work weeks that consist of many traveling hours are key components of entry level consulting in any field. That is no different for IT entry-level consultants. The average work week is 40 hours, but entry-level consultants are working upwards of 60 hours a week. That sounds physically and emotionally taxing; however, you are paid pretty well for your services. At the end of the day the hourly rate of pay isn’t as much as you would expect for the hours that you work, but the skills you gain in the field can propel you into any industry because technology is a global language. That is a major reason why IT consulting is so intriguing to me because it can help propel me into any industry I want, while simultaneously building my technology and communication skills. </p>
