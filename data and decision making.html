<h3 id="h3"> My Take on <cite> Digital IQ perspectives: Unlocking data possibilities </cite> By Chris Curran and Dan DiFilippo at PWC LLP </h3>	
	<p> As someone who wants to get involved in data analytics, insight into the world of decision making by executives enhanced by data is especially intriguing. Curran and Filippo mentioned in the survey that executives are faced with daily decisions that can mean a revenue-generating reward or a loss in revenue. Having the ability to view data that acts as a predictor of future consumer behavior is a vital part of the decision-making process. and even though the Digital IQ Survey done by PWC found that 77% of business and IT leaders know that data and analytics are important to their business, only 58% of them know how to effectively utilize data to drive business value. </p>
	<p> Data analysis technology has grown in recent years due to the wave of big data, and we now have the ability to build predictive models for consumer behavior based off of past behavior. These predictive analyses immensely help executives make decisions. That is a field of work I am particularly interested in as a future analytics and information management consultant. I want to be a part of the team of people who do data analysis using new data analytic software. </p>
<h3 id="h3"> Why Executives Want to Rely More on Data Analysis </h3>
	<p> We have already talked about how executives are faced with daily decisions that can ultimately reap a revenue-generating reward. Per the Digital IQ Survey done by PWC, 77% of executives and IT leaders say data and analytics are important for driving up business value. We know that data analysis, when presented in a meaningful way, can drive revenue and growth, but why is that the case. Brad Russell of Tech News World finds that increases in revenue that are directly correlated to data analysis are done in three ways: targeted and timely marketing, anticipating customer service needs and revolutionizing business models. </p>
	<p> Many of us have become accustomed to the merchandise recommendations that pop up after we buy something from Amazon or the ads we see after making a Google search. Those are just some examples of how big data analysis enhances business decisions. For example, Google may determine exactly how many Nike ads they want to run based off of the amount of Nike related searches they receive. That decision can only be made with data analysis, and that is just one reason why executives are starting to heavily rely on data analysis. </p>
	<p> Another reason why executives are relying more on data analysis is because of the predictive analyses that are possible using modern data analytic applications, according to Brad Russell Predictive analyses using big data can help in the process of developing a product or service your customers will buy next or what area of the world to discontinue a product. Those are just some examples of how predictive analyses can either generate revenue or save losses. </p>
	<p> Data analysis is also revolutionizing how and how often business models are changed, according to Brad Russell. He gives example of how insurance companies such as Progressive are starting to use driver data to customize policy premiums that can ultimately drive consumers away from other companies. The ability to change your business model in a way that means more revenue definitely helps companies gain a competitive advantage, and it is another major reason why executives are relying more on data analysis. </p>
<h3 id="h3"> Conclusion </h3>
	<p> It is an exciting time to be a data analytics consultant because of the sheer mass of raw data that each company stores in its database systems. Companies need data analysts to make sense of all of the data available, and that is why they are in high demand. As aforementioned, data analyses are becoming increasingly used by executives when they make decisions. That is more than reasonable as revenue can grow as a result of these decisions. However, analyses only enhance an executiveâ€™s decisions. As much as I believe in data driven decision-making as someone who wants to be an analytics consultant, I also believe that it is only there to enhance or aid a decision. The human element of decision-making is still extremely relevant because one cannot solely rely on analyses to make a decision. Some decisions are outside of the realm that is the analysis. Executives understand this and that is why they make the big bucks. These decisions that could affect millions of people are never easy, no matter how evident the analysis may seem. </p>
