<h3 id="h4"> My Take on <cite> Tips for Transforming Data Management </cite> By Deloitte CIO Journal</h3>	
	<p> Before data analytics happens, data management happens. The CIO journal for Deloitte Consulting LLP offers insight into what they can do to better manage data. According to the CIO journal, Chief Information Officers are realizing that their warehouses of data are becoming increasingly cluttered and insufficient as raw data continues to grow exponentially. Simply put, current data management technology is increasingly becoming useless as they cannot “create efficiencies, foster agility and scalability, help maintain regulatory compliance, or provide context.” That along with the digitization wave of data is what interests me the most in the field of data management consulting. Finding efficient and cost effective ways to manage raw data so that data scientists could, according to Victor Bocking, a managing director at Deloitte Consulting, “spend less time organizing data and more time performing advanced analysis,” is exactly where I’d want to be as a data management consultant. </p>
<h3 id="h4"> Datawatch’s solution to Better, More Efficient Data Preparation </h3>
	<p> According to the database trends and applications newsletter, Datawatch, a software company that manufactures analytics platforms has created a new monarch targeted at Tableau users. “Datawatch contends that many business users still spend too much time on obtaining, accessing, and preparing information, rather than on the actual analysis and visualization of results.” This statement represents the hottest topic within the world of data management. Business analysts are becoming more and more prevalent, while the technology that offers them with structured, on-time data to analyze is lagging. Datawatch is one of many companies to make an attempt at solving this problem. Oracle is another big player in developing systems such as this, but they have taken an approach that more specifically targets what seems to be an infinite amount of data on the cloud and Web 2.0. </p>
<h3 id="h4"> Conclusion </h3>
	<p> Technology that targets the data management side of the data analytics process has lagged, relative to the technology that supports data visualization and analytics. However, 2016 has seen an introduction of more of the data management software’s than any other year, but at the same time there aren’t enough people in the workforce with the data management skills that coincide with these new systems, and that is where I want to be as an IT consultant. </p>
